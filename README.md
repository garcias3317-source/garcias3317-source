## 📂 Featured Projects
*Explore the labs I've built to simulate enterprise-level environments.*

### 🏰 [Active Directory & Windows Server Lab](https://github.com/garcias3317-source/Active-Directory-Lab)
> **Goal:** deploy and manage a centralized corporate network using a Server-Client model. By building this environment, I simulated how an IT department manages an entire organization’s users and devices from a single point of control.
> 
* **Environment Deployment:** Installed and configured **Windows Server** (Domain Controller) and **Windows 10/11 Clients** to establish a functional Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment.
* **Directory Hierarchy:** Designed and implemented **Organizational Units (OUs)** to streamline user account management and administrative delegation.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Developed and linked **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to automate password requirements, enforce security banners, and standardize desktop backgrounds across the domain.
* **Operational Tasks:** Performed core Help Desk functions including account provisioning, password resets, and permissions.

### ☁️ [Microsoft 365 Administration & Data Recovery Lab](https://github.com/garcias3317-source/Office-365-Lab)
> **Goal:** Manage a cloud-native enterprise environment and and handle common IT support requests (tickets) in a realistic business setting.
* **Identity Management:** Provisioned user accounts and implemented **Role-Based Access Control ** by assigning the **Helpdesk Administrator** role to ensure the "Principle of Least Privilege."
* **Services:** Configured an **IT Shared Mailbox** with delegated "Send As" permissions and created an organization-wide **Distribution List**.
* **Recovery:** Simulated a critical data loss scenario by "permanently" deleting files from a user's OneDrive and successfully restoring them via the **Second-Stage Recycle Bin**.
* **Administration:**M365 Admin portal to manage global settings, mailbox permissions, and service health.
